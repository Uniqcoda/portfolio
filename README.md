# My Portfolio
Hello ðŸ˜€,

Here is the code for my website. You can find it deployed here: [my website](https://marye.netlify.app/)

I first did it with Wordpress when I was exploring the fun of drag and drop ðŸ˜„

I admired all the features I was able to add using Wordpress plugins like Elementor, and themes like OceanWP.

Then I asked myself "can I replicate the same thing in React?" I decided to try. Trust me, it wasn't easy ðŸ˜­

I wasn't easy making it responsive but I did it.

The most challenging part was the carousel. You need to see the code and the UI to understand my pains. I tried several react packages but I never got the result I wanted so I decided to build mine with javascript. 

If you have a faster or better way of doing it, please let me know.


PS: I have spent most of my dev career on the backend, so I am very proud of what I was able to achieve on the frontend through this website. So be kind with your judgement ðŸ˜€
